# Insufficient Error Handling in TypeScript Arithmetic Functions

This repository demonstrates a common error in TypeScript: insufficient error handling. The provided TypeScript code implements basic arithmetic functions (add, subtract, multiply, divide). While the `divide` function includes error handling for division by zero, the other functions lack comprehensive error checking.  This can lead to unexpected behavior and runtime errors in a production environment.

## Improvements

The solution demonstrates enhanced error handling by adding more robust input validation and type checking to the arithmetic functions.  This makes the code more reliable and less prone to unexpected behavior.
